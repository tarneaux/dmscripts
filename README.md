# dmscripts

This is my collection of little bash scripts that use dmenu to make your life easier.
To install them:
- Make sure `dmenu` is installed
- Clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/tarneaux/dmscripts`)
- Map some key (like super+d) to run this script in your window manager, desktop environment, etc.

## Dependencies

For `yt` script: yt-dlp, mpv, ytfzf


## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, it might be because running sudo requires a password. Either modify the scripts to ask for the password, or configure sudo with NOPASSWD.
